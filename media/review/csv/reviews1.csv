We will use Wheatley's book as the primary resource  for our professional growth at our MPS Middle School Principals  Collaborative institute August 9-11, 1999. We are not just concerned with  reform; we seek renewal as well. Wheatley provides the basis.

"Animals in Translation: Using the Mysteries of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior: Books: Temple Grandin Catherine Johnson Shelly Frasier",4.0,"Very very interesting","Carrie Gilder ""redgilder""","This book was someone else's bookclub selection and I think having no expectations when I picked it up really helped in my having that WOW experience that some folks report with this book and others miss. Yes the prose needed much better editing: overuse of repetition ""stock"" phrases and ""hanging"" assertions that should have been cleaned up.  However I found the discussions of brain development",pos
Leadership Without Easy Answers: Books: Ronald Heifetz,5.0,Best Leadership book I have read,Sara A. Barnaby,I have been studing leadership for over 15 years both by reading and experience.  I consider this book to be the best book I have read because it describes leadership as a learned activity.  It also says that leadership is in motivating people to do their own work in solving difficult problems. I found that as President of my congregation I was continually going back to the concepts in the book to lead it through a very difficult situation involving placement of the flags in the sanctuary.  It was very difficult to get people to do their own work and not try to step in to solve everything. (That would have been impossible anyway) I found that he described President Lyndon Johnson as a successful leader (civil rights) and unsuccessful leader ( Vietnam).  His discussion on leading without authority is new ground for me.    If you want to discuss the book with others there is an on-line book study at the Work and Worship Institute website. I found it was a good way for me to get more from the book. This is a great book with great stories of a variety of leaders in our society. ,pos

On Beauty: Books: Zadie Smith,5.0,Racism and infidelity,connoisseur15,Zadie Smith is one of the most powerful authors I have read in recent times. She is so subtle about the race factor that we don't get to find out the races of the protagonists till the first 50 pages or so. She has also captured the emotions of Kiki and Zora perfectly (why is it that women always stand out in emotional moments!) and the characters stay with you even after you put the book down.,pos
