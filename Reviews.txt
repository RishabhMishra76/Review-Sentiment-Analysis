Negative:-

Mic is not proper recipient persons can't hear proper sound ( every time for call I heard from front I can't hear you so I have to again talk to through Mobile phone no Option useless of wirless meaning) and sound quality is so loud. Like local headphones. not comfortable to wear for more than1 hrs of uses.tere is no meanings to get replaced again you get same product therefore this is wast of money.

After few day left ear stopped working 

Positive:-

Got it at Rs 850 which is a reasonable price. Compare to the price the product is ok. If u have a budget of about 2000 dnt go for it. It has a very short bluetooth distance.

Backup good but bass is enough but not say that for me it is like bass .. vocals are clear...quality good ....over all good at the price of 899
